    "Crystalline orientation data is usually stored using **Euler angles** (e.g. the EBSD community) as these provide a compact way (three numbers) of representing an full 3D orientation respect to a reference frame through a rotation. On the other hand, the **rotation matrix** is typically used for most operations. These two are the representations we will use most often.\n",

    "### Euler angles (Bunge convention)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any orientation can be expressed as three rotations around basis vectors. However, the definition of Euler angles is not unique and the order in which we concatenate rotation matters. This means that there are 12 different ways to sequence the rotations and these can be interpreted as extrinsic (relative to an external fixed coordinate system) or intrinsic (body/crystal-fixed coordinates) rotations resulting in 24 different conventions. Other disadvantages of using Euler angles for the representation of rotations (and orientations) are (1) rotation angles can be defined in radians or degrees, (2) the gimbal lock singularity, or that (3) it requires conversion to other representaions (e.g. rotation matrix or quaternions) to concatenate or interpolation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the EBSD community typically uses the Bunge convention, where the the sequence of rotations is $z$, $y$, $z$. Since our aim is to orientate crystals with respect to a fixed external reference frame (i.e. the sample), we are concerned with **extrinsic rotations** and the angles are usually given/stored in degrees. All of these constraints can be easily specified in the rotation module. For example, the sequence of axes for rotations uses a string with 3 characters (either x, y or z) using capitals for intrinsic rotations (e.g. ``'XYZ'``) and lower case for extrinsic rotations (e.g. ``'xyz'``), so that in an definition like teh one used above\n",

    "- The second parameter, ``[30, 45, 40]``, is the Euler angles as a Python list\n",
